# Project-when-in-college
This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects that I did while studying at President University. In this repository, there are programming assignments, academic assignments, and project assignments given to me by the lecturer. These assignments may involve topics related to programming languages ​​such as PHP, HTML, CSS, Java, and Java Script.

This repository aims to record and store work that I have completed during college, as well as to share knowledge and experiences with others.
